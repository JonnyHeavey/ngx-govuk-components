# ngx-govuk-components

This package contains several Angular components based on the GOV.UK website(s) interface.

This project aims to make the development of GOV.UK style applications easier within Angular 2+.

The styles are mostly derived from the official [govuk_frontend_alpha](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_alpha) project created by the Government Digital Service.
